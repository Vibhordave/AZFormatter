# AZFormatter

# Introduction

The AlgoZenith Formatter project aims to address a common challenge faced by competitive coders: maintaining clean and well-formatted code. By leveraging CodeMirror and beautify.js, provided under the MIT License, this project offers a browser extension called "Az Formatter" that automatically beautifies code written in AlgoZenith's Platform IDE. By ensuring proper indentation and formatting, the extension significantly reduces debugging time caused by errors stemming from poorly formatted code.

# Project Objectives:

1) Code Beautification: The AlgoZenith Formatter project focuses on transforming code into a visually appealing and standardized format. By automatically applying consistent indentation, spacing, and line breaks, the formatter enhances code readability, making it easier for programmers to understand and debug their code.

2) Seamless Integration with AlgoZenith's IDE: The project aims to provide a seamless user experience by integrating the Az Formatter as a browser extension directly into AlgoZenith's IDE. This allows competitive coders to effortlessly apply code formatting while working within the AlgoZenith platform, eliminating the need for manual formatting.

3) Language Support: Initially, the project will focus on supporting the C++ programming language, which is widely used in competitive coding. The formatter will ensure that C++ code adheres to best practices and industry standards, making it more maintainable and less error-prone.

4) Extensibility and Customization: The AlgoZenith Formatter project strives to offer extensibility and customization options to cater to the diverse needs of competitive coders. Users should be able to configure formatting rules, such as indentation style and line width, to align with their personal preferences or specific coding guidelines.

The AlgoZenith Formatter project offers a valuable solution for competitive coders, enabling them to easily format their code within AlgoZenith's IDE. By reducing the time spent on manual code formatting and improving code readability, the extension enhances the overall coding experience and minimizes debugging efforts. Visit the GitHub repository to contribute, collaborate, and be a part of this project that aims to simplify code formatting for competitive coding.

# Setup
1) Fork the repository.
2) Make a pull request or directly download the ZIP file.
3) Open the project in a code editor connected to gcc compiler or any service like CLion.
4) Login into account on AlgoZenith Platform.
5) Join the Az Demo course.
6) Code and use formatter to Beautify it!

# Problems Faced
1) **How to Beautify :** After a lot of research I finally came through the MIT licensed beautify.js.
2) **How to Extract :** After a lot of html code reading i got to know about CodeMirrors and How they are used in IDE and finally took help chatGPT to learn how to use it.
